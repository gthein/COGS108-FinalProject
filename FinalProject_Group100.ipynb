    "Nowadays, medical marijuana and recreational marijuana have been legalized in many states of the United States. With its popularity in the life and culture, we want to explore the relationship between marijuana usage and people's living conditions. The major factors of people's living conditions we consider in our exploration are demographic, education levels, and socioeconomic status. We hope that through our exploration, we will have a better vision of who is prone or susceptible to use and understand further how the usage of marijuana affects to people's overall living experiences."

    "The War on Drugs taught us that poorer demographics are prone to drug exposure and higher usage rates. However, with recent legalization of marijuana across multiple states, we’re curious to see if the validity of poverty and drug use still correlate. Every year the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) gives out a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. From these surveys, we will be able to gather information (our desired dataset) on drug use, age, and socioeconomic status of individuals across the country. What we currently know about the topic of marijuana use in the United States is that popularity has grown over the years. Medical use for marijuana has become more and more popularized, and recreational use as well, especially with the recent legalization. We also know that the media has an influence as well, especially to younger users. As popular artists and actors and influencers display the use of marijuana younger adults are more likely to follow. From the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration were learned that there were 26 million marijuana users in 2017, two million more than the previous year. \n",
    "\n",
    "For older adults, it was found by the NCBI that marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug by 50+ adults. The usage has increased by 71.4 percent in three years alone from 2013 to 2016. This large jump was found to be due to the more widespread use of medical marijuana. In younger populations, SAMHSA reported marijuana usage for three young age groups. The results show that 6.5 percent of 12-17 years olds, 22.1 percent of 18-26 years olds, and 7.9 percent of the 26+ group are current marijuana users. The NCBI also found that with the legalization of marijuana in Oregon, the usage among adolescents has raised from 2.9 in 2006 to 18.3 in 2015 in their sample. Interestingly a study by the NCBI found results for marijuana use in relation in neighborhood income that the neighborhood with the highest median income and Gini coefficient (inequality among income) had the highest prevalence of marijuana smoking. These results helped us hypothesize for three different use groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were unable to find any previous student projects that asked similar questions, but we looked at the methods and results of a project on if income does indeed hold a significant impact on the spread of communicable diseases, specifically the flu. They specifically looked at the San Diego area and were able to  compress the flu rate, median income and other values into regions with various hospitals using the pandas library. They then used the t-test where discharge/hospitalization rate is dependent on income/poverty and other possible confounds. They learned that there was a negative correlation between hospital discharge rates and household income. We plan to reference these methods as we conduct analysis on our own dataset, seeing there is parallelism in the prompts.\n",

    "After scouring through all the amazing resources Professor Shannon Ellis offered us, we were extremely fortunate to find the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), a national survey that included data on all aspects of our research question and hypothesis. This dataset is very large and comprehensive and is broken up into many different files, including a Demographic Dataset and Questionnaires Datasets that have information about drug usage (including marijuana) and living conditions like income and occupation. Every dataset is stored in a sas file, which we plan to use the pandas.read_sas method to help open our files. Each dataset has a comprehensive documentation that describes columns and possible values for the data. For example, the column “RIAGENDR” in the documentation gives us information of the participant’s gender with values 1 for Male, 2 for Female, and . for Missing. Since the 2017-2018 data is incomplete at the time we collect data for this research, we use the 2015-2016 survey data as the latest data for this project.\n",

    "Since our research question explores the trends in marijuana usage -- a sensitive topic that is deeply intertwined with the socioeconomic fabric and political discourse of the United States, we have decided to restrict our sources to academic, peer-reviewed, and government-funded research in order to ensure that our questions and hypotheses are rooted in empirical research and motivated by accurate facts. \n",

Given the data is government-funded research, and made accessible to the public, we believe to have permission to use this data in order to find correlations as long as there is no breach in privacy. \n",

    "\n",
    "In regards to our data having potential biases, the data was collected to represent a varied demographic shown by the codebook of our data source given by NHANES. Interviews were held in-home as to not exclude those that may not have computer access. The only issue may be that responses from participants younger than 16 had a proxy who provided information for them and for participants who could not answer the questions themselves. This could lead to misrepresentation of information if the proxy did not fully know the truth and/or younger children withholding information as to not \"get in trouble\", especially in regards to marijuana usage. Our topic specifically did hold an issue of having missing data or omitted responses towards marijuana use, most likely due to the not-yet legalization in most states of the drug. We handled this issue by cleaning the data and dropping the responses missing data. Luckily we were still left with a significant amount of responses to work with. "
